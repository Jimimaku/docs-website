We're excited to announce that you can now monitor the health of your Confluent Cloud Kafka Clusters.  This can be done through the new Confluent Cloud integration via API Polling.

Confluent Cloud allows developers to focus on building applications, microservices and data pipelines, rather than on managing the underlying infrastructure. For that reason, Confluent Cloud is one of the top providers of Kafka, with a large market share of all Kafka users.  
New Relic will allow for customer dashboards to be created on top of this data and will be releasing a Public Preview in February of a new capability for out of the box reports called Messages Queues and Streaming, which will allow for a seamless flow from the Clusters to Topics and then a deep dive into any APM service using Confluent Cloud for Kafka.  Until, all of the data will be available for use and custom dashboards can be created and saved. More information about the creation of custom dashboards can be found here.
