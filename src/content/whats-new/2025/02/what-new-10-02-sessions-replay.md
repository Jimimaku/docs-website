Tired of worrying about who can access and change your **Session Replay** settings? We're excited to announce a significant update to our **Session Replay** feature, offering users enhanced control over who can access and modify settings. This update introduces tailored roles, allowing product admins to create custom permissions specifically for **Session Replay**, ensuring a more secure and efficient management process.

## Why this is a big deal

Our customers have expressed challenges in managing access to **Session Replay** settings, particularly concerning unintended changes to settings like the sampling rate that lead to increased data ingest and costs. This update addresses those concerns by providing:

* **Control Costs:** Prevent unexpected data ingest spikes by managing who can adjust key settings.
* **Boost Security:** Protect sensitive data by limiting access to configuration options.
* **Simplify Management:** Streamline workflows with a clear, role-based approach to permissions.

## Key Features

With this update, users can now:

- **Define Tailored Roles:** Product admins can create custom roles with **Modify** permissions exclusively for **Session Replay**. This allows for precise control over who can adjust critical settings, eliminating the need for all-or-nothing access.
- **Precision Control:** Users with the **Modify** role can access **Session Replay** settings directly within the **Application Settings** page. They can fine-tune the sampling rates, mask sensitive text, and block site content, optimizing performance and protecting sensitive data.
- **Seamless Experience for Everyone:** Existing **Session Replay View/Read** users will continue to enjoy an uninterrupted experience viewing session listings. The settings will be hidden from them, ensuring a clean, focused workflow. If a Read user was previously responsible for updating settings, they will need to contact an admin to be moved into the **Session Replay Modify** role.

This update empowers teams to manage **Session Replay** settings with greater precision and security, aligning with their operational and compliance needs. By providing these enhancements, we aim to improve your workflow efficiency and ensure that your data management processes are both effective and secure.
