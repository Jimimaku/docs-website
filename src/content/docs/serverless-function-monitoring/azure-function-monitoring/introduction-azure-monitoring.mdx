New Relic's instrumentation for Azure functions offers deep visibility into the inner workings of your functions. By adding the New Relic agent to your function, each invocation is monitored by New Relic. This enables you to track the duration of function invocations, monitor errors, distributed tracing, and record details about the source events and your function's responses.

For Azure functions, the agent reports data such as distributed traces and logs, which are available under 'Services - APM' as an APM entity, unlike Lambda monitoring. However, a separate entity for Azure Functions will still exist with only the metric data.
