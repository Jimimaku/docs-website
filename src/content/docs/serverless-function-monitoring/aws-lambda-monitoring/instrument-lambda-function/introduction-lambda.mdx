As your organization transitions to a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) architecture with AWS Lambda, understanding and optimizing function performance becomes critical for ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.  Each Lambda invocation represents a potential bottleneck or opportunity for improvement.

New Relic's instrumentation for AWS Lambda provides deep visibility into the inner workings of your functions. By adding the New Relic agent to your function, each time your function is invoked, New Relic is too. You can gain insights into key performance metrics such as duration, cold starts, exceptions, and tracebacks.

This doc explains New Relic's Lambda monitoring architecture and walks you through linking your AWS and New Relic accounts. You must link your accounts before you can instrument your functions.

{/* ## How the Lambda instrumentation works [#how]

These are the essential elements of AWS Lambda instrumentation with New Relic:

* **Your function**: Your function is the code you want to understand. You want to know when it's encountering errors, why it's slow, or how often it gets invoked.

* **The New Relic agent or SDK**: Depending on the language your function is written in, New Relic provides different agents or SDKs. Their job is to do the actual monitoring of your code. It measures the duration of your function invocations, notes errors that occur, records details about the source events, and your functions responses. To do this, it needs to wrap around your Lambda invocation handler function.

* **The New Relic Lambda extension**: When you instrument the New Relic Lambda extension in your function, it will run inside the Lambda execution environment, alongside your code. It enhances the telemetry that the agent collects and sends it to New Relic's backend in batches. It can also send your function's logs to New Relic. You don't need the Lambda extension to monitor your function with New Relic. */}

## New Relic's Lambda monitoring architecture [#lambda-architecture]

New Relic's monitoring solution involves several key components:

* **Your Function**: The core code that requires monitoring to identify errors, performance issues, and invocation frequency.
* **New Relic Agent or SDK**: Tailored for different programming languages, these agents or SDKs wrap around the Lambda invocation handler to monitor execution duration, errors, and event details.
* **New Relic Lambda Extension**: This optional component runs alongside your code in the Lambda execution environment, enhancing telemetry data collection and sending it to New Relic's backend. It can also forward logs to New Relic.


## Shipping methods for Lambda telemetry [#shipping-methods]

There are three primary methods to ship telemetry data from AWS Lambda to New Relic, each with its own cost and reliability considerations:

* **Cost-Effective Method**: Utilize New Relic's layers, including the Lambda extension, which avoids sending data to AWS CloudWatch by default.
* **Reliability-Focused Method**: Disable the New Relic Lambda extension and use CloudWatch exclusively to ship data, reducing the Lambda function's overhead.
* **Hybrid Method**: Combine the extension with CloudWatch as a fallback, balancing cost efficiency with reliability.

## Instrumentation approaches[#instrumentation-approaches]
New Relic provides detailed documentation on instrumenting Lambda functions using various methods:

* [Layered instrumentation](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/instrument-your-own/)
* [Containerized instrumentation](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/containerized-images/)
* [SDK-based instrumentation](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/sdk-based-instrumentation/)

## Cost consideration [#costs]

Implementing serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda may incur additional AWS charges. The `newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda function, which reports data to New Relic, is considered a third-party service, and any associated AWS charges are the user's responsibility. 
By using the [`newrelic-lambda-extension`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension) included in [New Relic Lambda layers](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-layers), you can avoid sending logs and telemetry data via CloudWatch, although configuring the `newrelic-log-ingestion` function as a CloudWatch fallback is possible for high availability needs.

Enabling serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda may result in Amazon Web Services charges. Our `newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda function, which reports your Lambda data to us, is considered a [Third Party Service](/docs/licenses/license-information/acceptable-use-policy/acceptable-use-policy): AWS charges resulting from your use of it are your responsibility.

If you use our [newrelic-lambda-extension](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension) bundled in our [New Relic Lambda Layers](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-layers), you can avoid sending logs and telemetry via CloudWatch and the [newrelic-log-ingestion](https://github.com/newrelic/aws-log-ingestion) function. It's also possible to configure the [newrelic-log-ingestion](https://github.com/newrelic/aws-log-ingestion) function as a [CloudWatch fallback](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/cloud-watch-fallback/) method for functions that require high availability of observability data.
