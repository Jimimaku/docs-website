### Major changes

* Updated the compatibility reports for [Node.js agent](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent/).
* Enhanced the observability for front-end applications with the new auto logging feature, which is now available for Pro and Pro+SPA browser agents. This enhancement allows automatic collection of `console` log messages at the `WARN` level, supports sampling rate configuration, offers log viewing through the Logs page or Errors inbox, and adheres to standard data consumption pricing.
* Enables local log viewing on Linux systems and offers easy access for monitoring and troubleshooting the [KTranslate](/docs.newrelic.com/docs/network-performance-monitoring/advanced/ktranslate-container-health/) service.
* Improved connectivity and security by updating [network](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/networks/) blocks with new effective IP ranges.
* Revised the [OTLP](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-otlp/) release version, ensuring compatibility with both earlier and later versions.
* New Relic PHP agent allows [custom events](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/apm-report-custom-events-attributes/) creation, with a default limit of 30,000 per minute that can be increased to 100,000. It also supports the addition of custom attributes and provides guidelines on naming restrictions and event type limits.
* Updated for the deprecation and End of support for [NewRelic Xamarin NuGet Package](/docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-xamarin/monitor-your-xamarin-application/).

### Minor change
