### Removal of aws.region, aws.realm, aws.accountId and plugin.type attributes for the new AWS logs onboarding integrations

New Relic's one-step observability AWS services logs onboarding experiences were found to include undesired attributes in the ingested logs and have been fixed.

### Changed

* The AWS Lambda and Firehose log shipping integrations [released on December 18th 2024](/docs/release-notes/logs-release-notes/logs-24-12-18) will no longer include the `aws.region`, `aws.realm` and `aws.accountId` attributes in the ingested logs. These attributes, meant for internal use in the Logs product, should not appear as attributes on log data.
* The Firehose log shipping integration [released on December 18th 2024](/docs/release-notes/logs-release-notes/logs-24-12-18) should not have included a `plugin.type: "aws-firehose"` attribute in the ingested logs. We are removing this attribute in favor of the newly introduced `instrumentation.provider: "aws"` and `instrumentation.name: "firehose"` attributes.
