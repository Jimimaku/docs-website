In order for an account to share its data with other accounts within the
organization, it must elect to do so. This tutorial shows you how to use the
NerdGraph API explorer to update account elections for cross-account alerting.

<Callout variant="important">
  The cross-account elections can only be updated by a user with the
  "Data-sharing access control" permission for cross-account conditions. By
  default, this permission is only assigned to users with the "Organization
  Manager" role.
</Callout>

## Steps to update a cross-account alerting election

Follow these steps:

1. Collect your list of account IDs to update. The API will accept up to **20 account IDs**.
2. Indicate whether you want to enable (`true`) or disable (`false`) the election.
3. Use the NerdGraph API explorer to update the account elections.

Here's an example of the mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  alertsUpdateCrossAccountElections(
    accountIds: [YOUR_1ST_ACCOUNT_ID, YOUR_2ND_ACCOUNT_ID, YOUR_3RD_ACCOUNT_ID],
    electionStatus: true
  ) {
    electionStatus
  }
}
```
