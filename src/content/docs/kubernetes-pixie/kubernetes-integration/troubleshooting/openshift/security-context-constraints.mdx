## Problem

The service account for a container doesn't seem to have the correct permissions. 

## Solution

1. Find out what service account is running on that pod

```shell 
oc get pod <pod-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.serviceAccountName}' -n <namespace>
```

2. Add the privileged security context constraint (or the scc you want to use) to that service account

```shell
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure
```
