It's possible that you may see error messages when you check your New Relic infrastructure logs after the integration is installed.

These are some common errors you can see:

* [FluentBit Pods](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/troubleshooting/openshift/fluent-bit)
* [Error Populating KSM Metrics](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/troubleshooting/openshift/ksm)
* [Forbidden, not usable by user or service account](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/troubleshooting/openshift/security-context-contraints)
