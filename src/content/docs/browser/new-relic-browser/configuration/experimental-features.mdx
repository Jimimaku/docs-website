New Relic Browser features are exposed to customers in a controlled manner to ensure they are stable and reliable. However, some features are exposed before they generally available. These features are called **experimental features**. To access these features, you must opt in to use them.

## Current experimental features

The following experimental features are available in New Relic Browser:
* Browser Agent v1.272.0 - [Automatically track native marks and measures as `BrowserPerformance` events](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/marks-and-measures).

## Opt in to use experimental features

### Marks and Measures
<Callout variant="important">
  Experimental features are only available for opt-in on copy/paste or NPM implementations of the agent. These features are subject to change and should be used with caution.
</Callout>

1. Ensure you are using a version of the New Relic Browser agent compatible with the experimental feature, on a pro or pro+spa equivalent build.
2. Find the New Relic browser agent code in your webpage HTML or JS application.
3. In the `init` configuration object and add the `performance` feature configuration. Here's an example that enables both marks and measures detection:
  ```js
  <script type="text/javascript"> ;window.NREUM||(NREUM={});init={ â€¦, performance: {capture_marks: true, capture_measures: true} }:
  ```
4. Deploy your app.
