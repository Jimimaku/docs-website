[Marks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/mark) and [measures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/measure) are standard methods to observe and report on the performance of your webpages. They are generic events native to the browser and can be used to measure the duration of any task. New Relic Browser can automatically track these marks and measures as `BrowserPerformance` events.

<Callout variant="important">
This feature is currently experimental and is only available for opt-in on copy/paste or NPM implementations of the agent. Please see [experimental features](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/experimental-features) for more information on opting in to use experimental features. Please note that experimental features are subject to changes before general availability.

Marks and measures detected by the browser agent will be queryable through the `BrowserPerformance` event type. You can use this data to create custom queries and dashboards in [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one).

## Examine performance details [#view_details]

Example queries to view marks and measures data:

```nrql
FROM BrowserPerformance SELECT * WHERE appName = 'My Application' AND entryName = 'mark' OR entryName = 'measure'
```

```nrql
FROM BrowserPerformance SELECT average(entryDuration) WHERE appName = 'My Application' AND entryName = 'mark' OR entryName = 'measure' FACET entryName
```
