We have successfully built a fleet of LLM-enabled agents that automate common research and troubleshooting tasks while facilitating cross-platform agentic orchestration. In this new reality, engineers and other software professionals can work seamlessly in any system of their choice. They can effortlessly prompt their genAI assistant to coordinate with other assistants to complete tasks on their behalf. This innovation is Codename: O11.ai.

We have successfully leveraged an opportunity with MSFT/GH CoPilot to jumpstart this initiative. Together with MSFT/GH, we have co-developed a limited version of this product that integrates with GitHub CoPilot chat. We have continued to enhance and expand the initial integration, resulting in a more versatile offering that can be seamlessly integrated with a variety of tools across the SDLC/ITSM space. This solution is now capable of handling tasks across multiple domains in DevSecBizGitMLOps.
