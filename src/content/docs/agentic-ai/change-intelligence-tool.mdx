title: Change Intelligence Tool
---
We are thrilled to introduce a new feature in New Relic that significantly enhances your ability to use GitHub Copilot chat to inquire about an application's performance post-deployment. This feature provides detailed insights into your application's performance and stability following each new deployment, enabling you to swiftly identify and address any issues that may arise, ensuring a smooth and reliable user experience.

Your access to the New Relic observability platform grants you comprehensive visibility into all data related to your application.

### Feature highlights

- Tracking application performance post-deployment.
- **Aggregate report:** Provides a comprehensive summary of key performance metrics directly within your native GitHub Copilot experience, featuring:
    - Security vulnerabilities: Identification of new security vulnerabilities detected since the last deployment.
    - Log Issues: Detection of errors, warnings, or other log-related issues.
    - Tracing Information: Detailed tracing data for in-depth analysis.
    - Golden Signals: Alerts indicating anomalous values in latency, traffic, errors, or saturation.
    - hreshold Alerts: Notifications for alerts that exceed predefined thresholds.
    - Error Reporting: Comprehensive error tracking and reporting capabilities.
- **Direct Links:** Provides direct links to New Relic for further investigation of any surfaced issues, allowing for deeper insights and analysis.

### Getting Started
To begin using the Change Intelligence tool for deployments, ensure that both [New Relic AI](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-ai/#enable) and [Change Tracking](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-introduction/) are enabled. Detailed instructions for integrating the New Relic Change Tracking feature with GitHub Actions can be found [here](/docs/change-tracking/ci-cd/change-tracking-github-actions).

### Steps
By adhering to these steps, you can efficiently generate a Change Intelligence Report to evaluate the impact of your deployments and make informed decisions.

**Step 1: Enter the Initial Query**-

- To generate a Change Intelligence Report, execute the following command in the GitHub Chat extension:

- Prompt: Type `@newrelic how did my deployment for <entity_name> go?`

- This command will produce an output prompting you to select an associated New Relic account.

**Step 2: Select Account**

- To analyze a specific account, enter the following command:

- Prompt: Type `@newrelic select account <account_number>` or `use account <account-number>`

**Step 3: Select Deployment**

- To analyze a specific deployment, enter the following command:

- Prompt: Type `@newrelic analyze deployment <deployment_number>` or just `<deployment_number>`

- This action will generate the Change Intelligence Report.

**Information Outcomes**

In GitHub Copilot chat, there are three possible outcome summaries:
  1. Deployment Successful: The deployment was successful, allowing the user to proceed with the operation.
  1. Deployment Unsuccessful: The deployment failed, necessitating a rollback by the user. Up to three reasons for the failure may be provided.
  1. Conditional Deployment: The deployment is expected to succeed, but the user must resolve one specific issue beforehand.
