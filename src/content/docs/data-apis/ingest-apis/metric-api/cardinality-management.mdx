<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Cardinality refers to the number of unique elements in a set, specifically the unique attribute combinations observed for a given metric within a one-day period. This data resets daily at UTC midnight. As cardinality increases with more unique combinations, it can impact data limits. Understanding and managing cardinality is crucial for optimizing data usage and preventing limit issues.

As a New Relic administrator, you oversee data ingestion to ensure it stays within the specified limit of [GB Ingested](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#gb-ingested). <DNT>**Cardinality Management**</DNT> is one of the tools that offers graphs and tables to detail your data usage, allowing you to take action if you're approaching your limits. To view the Cardinality UI, go to **<DNT>[one.newrelic.com]</DNT>(https://one.newrelic.com) > (click your user name) > <DNT>Administration > Cardinality Management</DNT>**.

## Account Cardinality Breakdown [#account-breakdown]

If your organization has multiple accounts, you can view a breakdown of cardinality for each account. Use the account picker in the top right corner to switch accounts. The UI displays information for the selected account, provided you have access.

### Usage over time [#usage-over-time]

On the landing page of <DNT>**Cardinality Managemen**t</DNT>, you can view the <DNT>**Usage over time**</DNT> chart with the account's cardinality usage and limit.

<img
    style={{ align: 'left',maxWidth: '90%' }}
    title="Screenshot showing the usage over time chart"
    alt="Screenshot showing the usage over time chart"
    src="/images/apis-and-data_screenshot-crop_usage-over-time.webp"
/>

If the cardinality usage value remains unchanged, then a new data point isn't reported. So, you may see an empty data point. This isn't data loss.

To adjust the timeseries, use the time picker in the top right corner. This change only affects the timeseries and does't impact the Metrics table beneath it.
### Metrics table [#metrics-table]
Check the top 20 metrics with the highest cardinality in your account for the day. In the <DNT>**Metrics**</DNT> table, you see the breakdown of account cardinality organized by metric name.

<img
    style={{ align: 'left',maxWidth: '90%' }}
    title="Screenshot showing the metrics table"
    alt="Screenshot showing the metrics table"
    src="/images/apis-and-data_screenshot-crop_metrics-table.webp"
/>

All metrics have a default cardinality limit of 100,000. Based on your requirement, you can [adjust the pre-metric limits](#premetric-limit-adjustment).

## Metric cardinality breakdown [#metric-cardinality-breakdown]

Select any metric in the <DNT>**Metrics**</DNT> table to view its detailed cardinality information in an independent <DNT>**Cardinality management**</DNT> page.

<img
    style={{ align: 'left',maxWidth: '90%' }}
    title="Screenshot showing the Cardinality Management page"
    alt="Screenshot showing the Cardinality Management page"
    src="/images/apis-and-data_screenshot-crop_metric-cardinality-breakdown.webp"
/>
Cardinality bar charts show the current usage of the metric and account cardinality. The <DNT>**Usage over time**</DNT> chart displays the metric cardinality usage versus the limit of that metric. Below the timeseries, 

### Bar charts
In this metric-specific view, you can check current cardinality usage with two bar charts:
* <DNT>**Metric cardinality budget**</DNT>: Cardinality usage specific to the metric
* <DNT>**Account cardinality budget**</DNT>: Overall cardinality usage for your account

### Usage over time (for metrics) [#usage-over-time-metrics]

The <DNT>**Usage over time**</DNT> chart displays the metric cardinality usage versus the limit of that metric. You can adjust the time picker to view different time periods of this individual metric's cardinality data.

<Callout variant="tip">
    If a metric exceeds its cardinality limit, New Relic will still populate information for the metric, but it may be slightly slower as it uses raw data instead of aggregated data.
</Callout>

### Attributes table [#attributes-table]

The <DNT>**Attributes**</DNT> table lists the top 20 attributes that majorly contribute to the metric's cardinality. To view specific attribute information to decide its usefulness, click the menu on the right side of the attribute row. You can also create a pruning rule for the attribute from this menu.

## Account pruning rules [#account-pruning-rules]

A common method to maintain account cardinality within its limit is to implement pruning rules for attributes that are not deemed critical.

### View account pruning rules [#view-pruning-rules]

Select <DNT>**View Pruning Rules**</DNT> from the **Attribute** table to get a scrollable list of all pruning rules associated with the account. You can also delete pruning rules from this view.
<img
    style={{ align: 'left',maxWidth: '90%' }}
    title="Screenshot showing the link to pruning rules on the Attributes page"
    alt="Screenshot showing the link to pruning rules on the Attributes page"
    src="/images/apis-and-data_screenshot-crop_view-pruning-rules.webp"
/>

### Create a pruning rule [#create-pruning-rule]

You can create a pruning rule based on attributes within the UI. To create a pruning rule:

1. Select the attributes you want to prune. 
  <img
    style={{ align: 'left', maxWidth: '90%' }}
    title="Screenshot showing how to select attributes for pruning rule"
    alt="Screenshot showing how to select attributes for pruning rule"
    src="/images/apis-and-data_screenshot-crop_select-attributes-for-pruning-rule.webp"/>

2. Click <DNT>**Create pruning rule**</DNT>. The pop-up appears with information about how the pruning rule affects the metric's cardinality.
  
  <img
    style={{ align: 'left' }}
    title="Screenshot of page to name the pruning rule"
    alt="Screenshot of page to name the pruning rule"
    src="/images/apis-and-data_screenshot-crop_name-pruning-rule.webp"/>

3. Enter a rule name or description.
    
4. Click <DNT>**Submit**</DNT> to generate the pruning rule.

<Callout variant="important">
Pruning rules take effect immediately. Ensure you want to prune the data before creating a rule. You can delete a pruning rule after creating it, but the rule may prune some data before you remove it.
</Callout>

### Delete a pruning rule [#delete-pruning-rule]

To delete a pruning rule:

1. Go to the specific metric's <DNT>**Cardinality Management**</DNT> page.
2. From the Attributes table, click <DNT>**View pruning rules**</DNT>. A scrollable list of all pruning rules associated with the account appears.
2. Select <DNT>**View All Pruning Rules**</DNT>.
3. Scroll to the relevant pruning rule, and delete it. 

## Per-metric limit adjustment [#premetric-limit-adjustment]

When all attributes of a specific metric are crucial and you approach your cardinality limit, you can adjust the per-metric limit to meet your needs. Typically, metrics have a default maximum cardinality of 100,000, but you can increase this to as much as 1 million per metric.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Your account's overall cardinality limit still applies, so setting all your metric limits to 1 million without consideration could quickly exhaust your account's cardinality capacity.
</Callout>

### Edit per-metric limit [#edit-premetric-limit]

1. Go to the specific metric's <DNT>**Cardinality Management**</DNT> page.
2. Select <DNT>**Adjust metric budget**</DNT>.
3. Update the limit value to meet your needs. Make sure, it is less than or equal to 1 million.

The updated limit appears in the <DNT>**Cardinality Management**</DNT> page within a few minutes.
