An alert condition is the core element to target data that is reported to a different account that owns the condition. In certain situations, even if you're not directly responsible for an entity or data in another New Relic account, it may still be a dependency for you, and you might want to receive alerts about it. In these cases, the application team requests you to set up alerts on the host(s) running their application.
You can configure an alert condition to target data that is reported to a different account than owns the condition. You can manage your alerts in any account you have access to, regardless of where the data resides. This offers several benefits:

* Permits you write and edit access to accounts with data that others want to target to a minimum.

* Reduce alert clutter on accounts that have data that others want to use to target alerts.

* Reduce responsibility for managing others' alert thresholds and governance on accounts with data that others want to use to target alerts.

* View the incidents and issues you care about in one place.


## Create a new alert condition [#create-alert-condition]

To start using cross-account alerts, you must enable data sharing between accounts. Currently, this can only be done on a per-account basis, and you must have account admin user access.
You can create cross-account alert condition from:

* [A chart](/docs/tutorial-create-alerts/create-an-alert/).
    * Using a chart.
    * Using the guided mode.
* [The <DNT>**Alert coverage gaps**</DNT> page](https://one.newrelic.com/alerts-ai/detection-gaps/)

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > <DNT>**Alerts**</DNT> <DNT>**General**</DNT>.
2. Scroll down to the **Let other accounts query data from this account** option.
3. Click to enable for the cross-account alerts.
4. Click **Save**.

Now, any account in your organization can query data from this account in their alert conditions (as long as the user has at least read-only access to the data account). You can enter the account number you'd like your condition to target in the **dataAccountId** field in our condition builder API. Alternatively, you can use the **query mode** condition builder UI, and you'll see a new dropdown as part of the first step where you'll see the accounts that you've access to query for your new alert.

<Callout variant="caution">
  When an account stops sharing data (the Let other accounts query data from this account option is disabled), then:

    * The account is no longer an option to choose to target in new alert conditions.
    * Any previously created alert conditions targeting this account's data is disabled, and no longer evaluated. And the data related to the alert condition may still be available on the condition details page for a period of time.

## Disclaimer

Currently, when using this feature, any user who has at least read access to the owning account of the alert condition will be able to view any cross-account alert condition-related information, regardless of whether the user has read (or other) access to the account from which the data originated. The data they will be able to see includes:

* Condition names and details, including condition signals, facet names, etc.
* Issues and incidents pertaining to the cross account condition, including signals, facet names in the incident titles, etc.
* Workflows to set up notifications on cross account alert conditions.
