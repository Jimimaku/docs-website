Cross-account alerts in New Relic enables you to set up alert conditions that monitor data from a different account than the one where the alert is configured. This feature allows for greater flexibility in monitoring and managing dependencies across multiple accounts within New Relic.

In many organizations, different teams or departments may use separate New Relic accounts for their applications and infrastructure. Even if you are not directly responsible for an entity or data in another account, it may still be critical to your operations. For example, an application team might need to set up alerts for hosts that run their application but are managed under a different account.

This offers several benefits to:

* **Manage** alerts across multiple accounts you have access to, enabling a consolidated view of all relevant incidents and issues.
* **Limit** write and edit access to sensitive accounts, minimizing the need for multiple users to have permissions on accounts they do not directly manage.
* **Organize** alert configurations by reducing unnecessary alerts on accounts that serve as data sources for others.
* **Delegate** alert threshold management and governance to the appropriate teams, easing the burden on account owners.
* **Ensure** timely alerts for critical dependencies, even if they reside in different New Relic accounts.

## Get started [#get-started]

As a New Relic organization administrator, if you want to start using the cross-account alerts, you must enable the data sharing between accounts. This is currently be done only on a per-account basis. Alternatively, you must have a custom role configured for cross-account alert. Contact your organization manager to change the data-sharing settings for your account.

To allow other accounts to query data from the selected account:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > <DNT>**Alerts**</DNT>. 
2. Select <DNT>**General**</DNT> on the left navigation pane.
3. Go to **Cross-accounts** group bar, toggle **Let other accounts query data from this account** to enable.
4. Click **Save**.

Now, any account's alert condition in your organization can query data from this account, as long as the user has at least read-only access to the data account. 

## Create a cross-account alert condition

You can create:

* Enter the account number you'd like your condition to target in the `dataAccountId` field in our condition builder API. For more information, refer to [NRQL alert syntax.](/docs/tutorial-create-alerts/create-an-alert/create-alert-condition/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#syntax)
  
  -OR-

* You can use the **query mode** condition builder UI, and you'll see a new drop-down as part of the first step where you'll see the accounts that you've access to query for your new alert. For more information, refer to [Create alert condition using query mode.](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#advanced-signal-settings)

## Entity health status

At this time, the entity health status is not affected by any cross-account alert conditions.

## Restrict data sharing for cross account alerts

When an account stops sharing data (the **Let other accounts query data from this account** option is disabled), then:

* The account is no longer an option to choose to target in new alert conditions.
* Any previously created alert conditions targeting that account's data will be deleted, and stop evaluating.

## Data visibility

Currently, when using this feature, any user who has at least read access to the owning account of the alert condition will be able to view any cross-account alert condition-related information, regardless of whether the user has `read` (or other) access to the account from which the data originated. The data they will be able to see includes:

* Condition names and details, including condition signals, facet names, etc.
* Issues and incidents pertaining to the cross account condition, including signals, facet names in the incident titles, etc.
* Workflows to set up notifications on cross account alert conditions.
