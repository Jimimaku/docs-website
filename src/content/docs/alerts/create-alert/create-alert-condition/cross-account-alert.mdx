Cross-account alerts in New Relic provide the capability to configure alert conditions that target data reported to a different account than the one that owns the alert condition. This feature allows for greater flexibility in monitoring and managing dependencies across multiple accounts within New Relic.

In many organizations, different teams or departments may use separate New Relic accounts for their applications and infrastructure. Even if you are not directly responsible for an entity or data in another account, it may still be critical to your operations. For example, an application team might need to set up alerts for hosts that run their application but are managed under a different account.

This offers several benefits:

* **Centralized Alert Management:** Manage alerts across multiple accounts you have access to, allowing you to view all relevant incidents and issues in one place.
* **Minimized Access Requirements:** Limit write and edit access to sensitive accounts, reducing the need for multiple users to have permissions on accounts they do not directly manage.
* **Reduced Alert Clutter:** Keep alert configurations organized by reducing unnecessary alerts on accounts that serve as data sources for others.
* **Simplified Governance:** Delegate alert threshold management and governance to the appropriate teams, reducing the burden on account owners to manage alerts for others.
* **Improved Dependency Monitoring:** Ensure that you receive timely alerts for critical dependencies, even if they reside in different New Relic accounts.

## Get started [#get-started]

To start using cross-account alerts, you must enable data sharing between accounts. Currently, this can only be done on a per-account basis, and you must have account admin user access.

To allow other accounts to query data from the selected account:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > <DNT>**Alerts**</DNT> <DNT>**General**</DNT> on the left navigation pane.
2. Scroll down to the **Cross-accounts** group bar, toggle **Let other accounts query data from this account** to enable.
4. Click **Save**.

Now, any account in your organization can query data from this account in their alert conditions, as long as the user has at least read-only access to the data account. You can enter the account number you'd like your condition to target in the `dataAccountId` field in our condition builder API. Alternatively, you can use the **query mode** condition builder UI, and you'll see a new dropdown as part of the first step where you'll see the accounts that you've access to query for your new alert.

To create cross-account alert condition using the query mode:

    * Go to [one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > <DNT>**Alerts**</DNT>.
    * Select <DNT>**Alert Conditions**</DNT> in the left navigation.
    * Then select <DNT>**New alert condition**</DNT>.
    * Select <DNT>**Write your own query**</DNT>.
    * Select an account from the drop-down list, to monitor.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Click Multi-account, to select multiple accounts up to 30.
    </Callout>
    
    * Click **Run** to run the query.
    * Click **Next**. The Add details page appears.
    * Type a **name** to your alert condition.
    * Click **Save condition**.

      You can also create a cross-account alert condition from [Dashboard](/docs/tutorial-create-alerts/create-an-alert/).

## Entity health status

At this time, the entity health status is not affected by any cross-account alert conditions.

## Disallow data sharing for cross account alerts

When an account stops sharing data (the **Let other accounts query data from this account** option is disabled), then:

* The account is no longer an option to choose to target in new alert conditions.
* Any previously created alert conditions targeting this account's data is disabled, and no longer evaluated. And the data related to the alert condition may still be available on the condition details page for a period of time.

## API builder

To enable this feature use the API...

## Data visibility

Currently, when using this feature, any user who has at least read access to the owning account of the alert condition will be able to view any cross-account alert condition-related information, regardless of whether the user has `read` (or other) access to the account from which the data originated. The data they will be able to see includes:

* Condition names and details, including condition signals, facet names, etc.
* Issues and incidents pertaining to the cross account condition, including signals, facet names in the incident titles, etc.
* Workflows to set up notifications on cross account alert conditions.
