The <InlinePopover type="mobile"/> capability includes a monthly, weekly or daily report with a line chart tracking the number of devices, sessions or users running your app for each month, week or day over the last year and a line chart to visualize this data over time. To view the report: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile > (select an app) > Usage > Active users**</DNT>.

## Active users details [#details]

Use the dropdowns in the filter bar to set you time window to monthly, weekly or daily and to set your metric to devices, sessions or users. Additionally, use the version, os version, device group, and custom filters to further filter your data.


To see the total number of devices, sessions or users for any time period, mouse over the line in the line chart. The current time period's value is a month-to-date, week-to-date or day-to-date value and does not indicate the full month, week, or day's usage.


The active users table displays the chosen time period, as specificed by the filter selected, the unique metric and a comparison to the previous time period. For example, if `Monthly` is selected, the table will show the last 12 months, the unique data for those months, and a percent increase or decrease from the previous month.

To drill down into detailed information, click on a row of the table. This will open a stacked view with a detailed line chart for that time period.

Unique users are used to calculate your [monthly usage](/docs/accounts/new-relic-account-usage/mobile-usage/mobile-subscription-usage-ui), which is used to calculate your subscription level.

## Device tracking [#tracking]

Mobile monitoring does not use hardware identifiers for unique install tracking.

* On iOS we use the IdentifierForVendor property. (Versions 5.3.4 and lower used the SecureUDID library.)
* On Android we generate a unique GUID when the application is installed.
