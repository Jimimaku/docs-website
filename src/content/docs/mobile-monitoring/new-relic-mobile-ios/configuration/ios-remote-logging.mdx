## Logging Guidelines

### Overview

To ensure consistent and comprehensive logging throughout the project, the iOS agent provides logging APIs. Using the agent's logging APIs is the best way to send your mobile apps logs to New Relic. Your logs will be in one place where you can analyze them. For more information on our [mobile logging api](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/mobile-logs/#ios).

## Configuring log levels

### Agent Log Level
The agent log level is configured in the New Relic agent and determines which log messages are written to the device's console. This will include the logs our agent uses, to see all logs the agent uses set the log level to `NRLogLevelDebug`.

### Remote Log Level
The remote log level is configured in New Relic One (NR1) and determines which log messages are sent from the device to New Relic. This setting allows you to control the verbosity of logs that are transmitted and stored remotely, helping to manage data volume and focus on relevant information.

Configuration: The remote log level can be set in the Application tab of the New Relic One dashboard. For more information on setting the remote log level, see [mobile logs](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/mobile-logs).

## Automatic log collection

If remote logging is turned on in New Relic One the iOS agent collects all logs written by the app to stdout and stderr. It captures all calls to `NSLog()`,  Swift `print()`, and other print-family functions. The default level of logs collected in this way is `NRLogLevelInfo`. This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled using the `NRFeatureFlag_AutoCollectLogs` feature flag.
The agent uses a `'\n\n'` delimiter to separate log messages. The timestamp of the log message is the time the log was collected by the agent, not the time the log was written by the app. This might cause several milliseconds of difference because the log message was buffered before being collected by the agent.

<Callout variant="warning">
This feature interferes with Xcode's built in console so it can not be enabled while the debugger is attached.
