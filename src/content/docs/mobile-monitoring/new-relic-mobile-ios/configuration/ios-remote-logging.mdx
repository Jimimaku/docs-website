# Logging with the New Relic iOS agent
## Logging Guidelines

### Overview

To ensure consistent and comprehensive logging throughout the project, it is recommended to use the provided agent logging APIs. Our logging APIs offer various logging levels to capture different types of messages. For more information on our [mobile logging api](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/newrelic-logger).

## Configuring log levels

### Agent Log Level
The agent log level is configured in the New Relic agent and determines which log messages are written to the device's console. This will include the logs our agent uses, to see all logs the agent uses set the log level to NRLogLevelDebug. For more information on setting the agent log level, see [mobile logs](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/mobile-logs).

### Remote Log Level
The remote log level is configured in New Relic One (NR1) and determines which log messages are sent from the device to New Relic. This setting allows you to control the verbosity of logs that are transmitted and stored remotely, helping to manage data volume and focus on relevant information.

Configuration: The remote log level can be set in the Application tab of the New Relic One dashboard. For more information on setting the remote log level, see [mobile logs](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/mobile-logs).

## Auto Collect logs

The auto log functionality of the iOS agent collects all logs written by the app to stdout and stderr. It captures all calls to `NSLog()`,  Swift `print()`, and other print-family functions. The default log level of logs collected in this way is NRLogLevelInfo.
The timestamp of the log message is the time the log was collected by the agent, not the time the log was written by the app. This might cause several milliseconds of difference because the log message was buffered before being collected by the agent.

This feature interferes with Xcode's built in console so it is disabled while the debugger is attached.
