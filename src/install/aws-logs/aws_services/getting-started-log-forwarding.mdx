Forward your AWS logs into New Relic to have enhanced visibility into system performance, enable the early detection of issues, and take informed decisions. Our log management solution helps you enhance your team's operational efficiency while maintaining security and compliance.


By setting up an AWS integration with a CloudFormation template via New Relic, you can configure and ingest logs and metrics into New Relic. You can also set up integration for both logs and metrics together using a single CloudFormation template.

For more details on how to send New Relic metrics data via Terraform or API Polling, refer [Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams](/install/aws-cloudwatch/).

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites-aws-integration]

Before you strat integrating the AWS account with New Relic, ensure you have the following:
* An AWS account with [permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/gettingstarted-prereqs-permissions.html) to deploy new AWS resources and [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html)
* A New Relic account with [log forwarding setup](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions/#logs)
* A New Relic [license key](https://one.newrelic.com/api-keys)

## AWS log forwarding methods [#log-forwarding-methods]


You can forward logs from AWS S3 and CloudWatch to New Relic using the following methods. Depending on your needs, you can select the appropriate one during configuration setup:

* **Amazon S3 via New Relic Lambda function**: Provides high control over data transformation before forwarding from S3.
* **Amazon CloudWatch via New Relic Lambda function**: Provides high control over data transformation before forwarding from CloudWatch.
* **Amazon CloudWatch via Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose**: Ideal for direct and high-volume data streaming from CloudWatch.
