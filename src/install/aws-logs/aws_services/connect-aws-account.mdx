Create a CloudFormation Stack to ingest data into New Relic.

1. Provide a unique name for your stack.
2. If you do not have a New Relic license key, select <DNT>**Create a new key > Copy key**</DNT>.
3. Select <DNT>**Launch your Cloudformation in AWS**</DNT>. AWS Cloud Console opens with the <DNT>**Quick create stack**</DNT> form.
4. Paste the New Relic license key in the <DNT>**New Relic Ingest License Key**</DNT> field. The fields auto-populate the data you have entered in New Relic. You can further change the values here, if required.
5. Read through the <DNT>**Launch your Cloudformation in AWS**</DNT> and acknowledge for the necessary capabilities.
6. Select <DNT>**Create stack**</DNT>. It may take several minutes to create the new stack.
7. Go to the <DNT>**Connect your data AWS Account**</DNT> page in the New Relic platform instance.
8. Continue with the licence key:
   * If you are using an existing license key, paste it in <DNT>**License key**</DNT> and continue.
   * If you have created a new key, just select <DNT>**Continue**</DNT>. 
10. Select <DNT>**See your data**</DNT>. The logs start appearing in New Relic.
