Configure triggers to specify which log data should come to New Relic, and select an endpoint where the logs will reside.

1. Specify the data sources. You can add upto 40 S3 buckets or log groups for one AWS account integration.
   * <DNT>**S3**</DNT>: Enter the S3 bucket name, and prefix if any. You can select <DNT>**+ S3 bucket**</DNT> to add multiple S3 buckets.
   * <DNT>**CloudWatch**</DNT>: Enter the log group name, and filter if any. You can select <DNT>**+ Add log group**</DNT> to add multiple log groups.
2. Check the endpoint for storing the logs, and change if required. The default endpoint is set as per your New Relic account region. 
3. Add custom attributes to organize your logs and make them easier to search, filter, analyze, and parse.
4. Click <DNT>**Continue**</DNT>.
