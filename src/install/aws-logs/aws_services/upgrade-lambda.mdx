When upgrading from the old Lambda to the new unified Lambda, consider the following important points to ensure a smooth transition:

* **Handling existing Lambdas**
    The old setup may have separate Lambdas for S3 and CloudWatch log ingestion. Before migrating to the new unified Lambda, either delete these old Lambdas or manually remove their triggers. This step is crucial to prevent any conflicts or duplication of data processing.
* **Avoiding trigger or subscription duplication**
    Ensure that you do not create duplicate triggers or subscriptions when using both <DNT>**S3 Via Lambda**</DNT> and <DNT>**CloudWatch Via Lambda**</DNT>.
* **Monitoring service limits**
    Be aware of the service limits on reading logs from S3 and CloudWatch, as exceeding these limits can cause inconsistencies in the data reaching New Relic.
